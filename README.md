# Load flow Analysis Power Systems
### IIT Patna - Course EE381

MATLAB programs for solving the power-flow equations using either of methods: Gauss-Seidel (G-S), Newton-Raphson (N-R) & Fast Decoupled Load Flow (FDLF).


* The key information presented in power flow analysis is the magnitude and phase angle of voltage at each bus and the real and reactive power flowing in each transmission lines.
* The purpose of any load flow analysis is to compute precise steady-state voltages magnitudes and angles of all buses in the network, the real and reactive power flows into every line and transformer, under the assumption of known generation and load.
* Power flow analysis is the backbone of power system analysis and design and are necessary for planning, operation, economic scheduling and exchange of power between utilities.
